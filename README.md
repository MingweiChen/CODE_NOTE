# CODE_NOTE
Generally, I collect some papers, codes and websites to make me remeber some interesting and brilliant ideas. Most of problems are from leetcode. If I have some free time, I will make a index for the materials. If you like my shares, please fork or star this project. Also,  i am happy to share my own thoughts via my tech blog: 104.156.225.20. After some time, I will assign a domain to it. 
Happy code from here! Contact me: mwchen1994@gmail.com
